JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995 for the purpose of allowing code in web-pages (performing logical operation on client side).

        It is not compiled but translated. JavaScript Translator is responsible to translate the JavaScript code which is embedded in browser.
        
        Netscape first introduced a JavaScript interpreter in Navigator 2. The interpreter was an extra software component in the browser that was capable of interpreting JavaSript source code inside an HTML document. This means that web page 
        developer no need other software other than a text editor of develop any web page.</p>
